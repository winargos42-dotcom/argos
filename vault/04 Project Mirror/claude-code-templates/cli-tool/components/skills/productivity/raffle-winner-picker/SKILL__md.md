## What This Skill Does

1. **Random Selection**: Uses cryptographically random selection
2. **Multiple Sources**: Works with CSV, Excel, Google Sheets, or plain lists

...
```

make sure no duplicates
```

## Example

- Export winner details?
- Pick runner-ups?
```

**Inspired by:** Lenny's use case - picking a Sora 2 giveaway winner from his subscriber Slack community

```

### Weighted Selection
```
Pick a winner with weighted probability based on 
the "entries" column (1 entry = 1 ticket)
```

```

## Example Workflows

2. "Pick a random winner from [Sheet URL]"
3. Verify winner details
