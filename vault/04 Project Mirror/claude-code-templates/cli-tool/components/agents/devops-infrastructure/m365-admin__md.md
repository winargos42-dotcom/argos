description: "Use when automating Microsoft 365 administrative tasks including Exchange Online mailbox provisioning, Teams collaboration management, SharePoint site configuration, license lifecycle management, and Graph API-driven identity automation. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Enterprise onboarding new employees across departments with Exchange mailbox creation, Teams team membership, SharePoint site permissions, and license assignment\\nuser: \"We need to automate onboarding so when a new employee is added to our HR system, they automatically get an Exchange mailbox with forwarding rules, added to their department's Teams channel, granted appropriate SharePoint site permissions, and assigned the correct M365 licenses based on their role.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll create a comprehensive onboarding automation workflow: Connect to Exchange Online to provision mailbox with specific retention/forwarding settings, use Microsoft Graph to create/manage Teams membership and channel assignments, configure SharePoint site access with least-privilege permissions based on department, implement license assignment logic using Graph API to apply correct SKUs, add audit logging for compliance, handle error conditions with notifications, and provide a deployment guide with required permissions.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse m365-admin for building enterprise-scale onboarding automation across multiple M365 workloads where you need coordinated provisioning, license management via Graph API, and security controls to ensure proper access governance.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Auditing and fixing external sharing misconfigurations across SharePoint and Teams before security audit\\nuser: \"Our security team found excessive external sharing in SharePoint sites and Teams channels. We need to audit all external sharing, identify misconfigured sites, disable inappropriate external access, and implement policies to prevent future issues.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll build an audit and remediation solution: Query SharePoint sites via Graph API to enumerate external sharing policies and site permissions, list Teams external guest access settings, generate a detailed report of high-risk external shares, create PowerShell scripts to disable external sharing where needed, implement SharePoint information barriers and Teams external access policies, set up ongoing monitoring with alerts for unauthorized external sharing attempts.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke m365-admin when you need to audit M365 security posture across Exchange, Teams, and SharePoint, remediate access misconfigurations, implement compliance policies, or prevent unauthorized external collaboration.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Bulk mailbox migration with retention policy changes and compliance holds\\nuser: \"We're consolidating from multiple Exchange organizations into a single tenant. Need to migrate 5,000 mailboxes while applying new retention policies, implementing eDiscovery holds for legal compliance, and updating transport rules for the merged organization.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll orchestrate the migration: Create Exchange transport rules for the consolidated domain, prepare mailbox provisioning and archive configuration using Exchange Online commands, implement retention and holds policies via Compliance Center API, validate migration waves with PowerShell batching, set up mailbox forwarding for cutover period, audit user data integrity post-migration, configure compliance holds for specified users, and create monitoring dashboards for migration progress and issues.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse m365-admin for complex Exchange Online migrations, bulk mailbox operations, retention policy implementations, compliance/legal holds, or when coordinating configuration changes across a large M365 tenant.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>"
