## Content

---
description: "Deep product analysis before creating videos, presentations, or ads. Use when: 'analyze product', 'extract value', 'product brief', 'what makes this product special', 'prepare brief', 'understand the product', 'video brief'. Takes a URL or product description and outputs a structured brief with core insight, enemy, transformation, proof, mechanism, and emotional hooks. Based on JTBD, StoryBrand, Obviously Awesome (April Dunford), and Value Proposition Canvas frameworks."

# Product Meaning Extractor

Extract the REAL value from a product before writing a single line of video/presentation code. Without this step, content is a flat list of features. With it, content tells a story.

## Why This Exists

Most product videos fail because they skip analysis. They grab text from a landing page and lay it over animations. The result: "We have feature A, B, C. Try us." - nobody watches past 3 seconds.

This skill forces you to find what actually matters: the enemy, the transformation, the mechanism, and the emotional hook. Everything else flows from these.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Raw Material

**From the product URL:**
1. Visit the site, extract ALL text (hero, features, pricing, about, FAQ)
2. Screenshot key visuals (hero, before/after, product shots)
3. Extract brand colors from CSS (`--primary`, `--accent`, meta `theme-color`)
4. Note the tone: formal/casual, technical/simple, premium/accessible

**From reviews/testimonials (if available):**
1. Find testimonials on the site itself
2. Check App Store / Product Hunt / G2 / Trustpilot / Reddit mentions
3. Extract VERBATIM customer phrases - their words always beat your words

### Step 2: The "So What?" Test

For EVERY feature on the site, ask "So what?" until you reach the real value. Most features need 3-4 "so what?" iterations:

```
Feature: "Outputs .PSD with layers"
So what? → "You can edit individual elements"
So what? → "You don't redo the whole job if one thing is wrong"
So what? → "It saves hours of re-work and frustration"
REAL VALUE: "Never redo work from scratch again"
```

```
Feature: "AI-powered analysis"
So what? → "It finds patterns humans miss"
So what? → "Decisions are based on data, not gut feeling"
So what? → "You stop guessing and start knowing"
REAL VALUE: "Confidence in every decision"
```

Do this for every feature. Most products have 3-4 real values buried under 10+ feature bullets.

### Step 3: Fill the Product Brief

Output this structured brief (fill EVERY field, mark unknowns as `[needs data]`):

```markdown
# Product Brief: [Product Name]

## Core Insight
[One sentence: WHY does this product exist? Not what it does - why the world needs it.
Test: remove the product name. If the sentence still makes sense, it's good.
BAD: "ProductX uses AI to optimize workflows" (about the product)
GOOD: "Creative teams shouldn't choose between speed and quality" (about the world)]

## Enemy
[What is specifically bad without this product? Be concrete and visceral.
BAD: "Manual work is time-consuming"
GOOD: "Retouchers spend 45 minutes per photo removing scratches pixel by pixel.
       A 200-product catalog = 150 hours of mind-numbing work. Client wants changes? Start over."
The enemy should make the reader think: "yes, that's exactly my problem."]

## Transformation
**Before:** [A specific "day in the life" WITHOUT the product. What does the person DO, FEEL, WASTE?
            Write it as a mini-scene, not a bullet point.]
**After:**  [Same person WITH the product. What changed? Be specific about outcomes AND feelings.]

## Unique Mechanism
[HOW does it solve the problem? The specific approach that makes it different.
BAD: "Uses AI to improve results"
GOOD: "Pixel-level neural retouching that preserves original resolution and DPI,
       outputting editable .PSD with layers - not a flattened, compressed JPG"
The mechanism answers: "Why should I believe this works?"]

## Proof Points
1. [Hard number/stat: "2x faster", "10,000 customers", "$2M saved"]
2. [Social proof: specific companies/people who use it]
3. [Comparison: "vs [alternative], we [specific advantage]"]
4. [If no hard data available: mark as [needs data] and suggest what to measure]

## Emotional Hooks (rank top 3)
Pick the strongest emotional transitions for this specific product:
- [ ] Frustration → Relief ("Stop spending hours on...")
- [ ] Fear → Safety ("Never lose quality when...")
- [ ] Chaos → Control ("Finally, one tool that...")
- [ ] Shame → Pride ("Deliver work that...")
- [ ] Scarcity → Abundance ("Unlimited [X] without...")
- [ ] Complexity → Simplicity ("Just upload and...")
- [ ] Slow → Fast ("[X] in seconds, not hours")
- [ ] Expensive → Affordable ("Premium results at...")
- [ ] Isolation → Belonging ("Join [X] teams who...")
- [ ] Ignorance → Insight ("Finally see what...")

## Customer Language Bank
### Pain phrases (how they describe the problem):
- "[verbatim from reviews/testimonials]"
- "[verbatim]" 
- [If no reviews found: write 3 plausible pain phrases based on the enemy, mark as [inferred\]\]

### Desire phrases (how they describe the dream state):
- "[verbatim]"

### Objection phrases (what they worried about before buying):
- "[verbatim or inferred]"

## Target Audience (max 3, ranked)
1. [Primary: WHO + their specific context + why they care MOST]
2. [Secondary: ...]
3. [Tertiary: ...]

## Competitive Positioning (April Dunford framework)
- **Competitive alternatives:** [What would they use if product didn't exist?]
- **Unique attributes:** [What can ONLY this product do?]
- **Value:** [What does the unique attribute enable?]
- **Target customer:** [Who cares most about that value?]
- **Market category:** [What frame makes the value obvious?]

## Brand Signals
- **Colors:** [Primary, accent, bg - with hex codes]
- **Tone:** [formal/casual, technical/simple, premium/accessible]
- **Visual style:** [dark/light, minimal/rich, photo-heavy/text-heavy]

## Video Angle Recommendations
### Angle 1: [Name] (best for [15s/30s/60s])
**Hook:** "[Specific opening line using customer pain phrase]"
**Structure:** [Narrative arc: PAS / BAB / Apple Keynote / Before-After]
**Key scene:** [The single most powerful visual moment]
**CTA:** "[Specific call to action]"

### Angle 2: [Name]
...
```

### Step 4: Brief Validation Checklist

Run these checks before using the brief:
- [ ] Core insight doesn't mention the product name (it's about the WORLD, not the product)
- [ ] Enemy is specific enough to make someone say "that's me"
- [ ] Transformation includes FEELINGS, not just features
- [ ] Mechanism explains HOW, not just "AI-powered"
- [ ] At least one proof point has a hard number
- [ ] Customer language uses real or realistic phrases, not marketing speak
- [ ] No more than 3 target audience segments (focus!)
- [ ] At least 2 video angles suggested with different hooks

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Feature listing | "We have X, Y, Z" - nobody cares about features | Use "So What?" test to find real values |
| Jargon | "Leveraging proprietary algorithms" | Use customer words, test: would a friend say this? |
| Vague enemy | "Current solutions are inadequate" | Inadequate HOW? Add numbers, time, frustration |
| Missing mechanism | "Better results" | HOW better? What's the secret sauce? |
| No tension | No enemy = flat content | The enemy must be REAL and FELT |
| Generic emotions | "Save time" | Time for WHAT? "Get home before kid's bedtime" |
| Company-first | "We are the leader in..." | Customer-first: "You deserve..." |

## Frameworks Reference

**JTBD (Jobs-to-be-Done):**
- Functional job: What task are they trying to accomplish?
- Emotional job: How do they want to feel?
- Social job: How do they want to be perceived?

**StoryBrand (Donald Miller):**
1. Hero (customer) has a Problem
2. Meets a Guide (your product) with Empathy + Authority
3. Who gives them a Plan
4. Calls them to Action
5. Helps them avoid Failure
6. And achieve Success

**Obviously Awesome (April Dunford):**
Competitive alternatives → Unique attributes → Value → Target customer → Market category

**Value Proposition Canvas (Strategyzer):**
Customer: Jobs + Pains + Gains ←→ Product: Products + Pain Relievers + Gain Creators

## Gotchas

- Don't skip the "So What?" test - it's where insights hide behind features
- Customer language > clever copywriting. Always.
- If you can't find the enemy, the product might not have a clear positioning - flag this
- Brief should take 10-15 minutes of real analysis. 2-minute briefs are too shallow
- Update the brief as you learn more during content creation
- The brief is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for all subsequent work (video, ads, slides)
