# Architectural Principles for AI Agent Systems

A collection of 17 battle-tested principles for building reliable, high-quality AI agent workflows. Each principle is self-contained and can be adopted independently, but they compose well together.

---

## Principles Overview

### [01 - Harness Design](01-harness-design.md)

Multi-agent architecture patterns for long-running AI applications. Separates generation from evaluation to overcome self-evaluation bias. Defines when a solo agent suffices and when the 20x cost of a full harness is justified.

**When to use:** Building any multi-step AI workflow where quality matters more than speed. Designing evaluation systems. Planning agent architectures.

**Source:** Anthropic Engineering -- "Harness design for long-running apps"

---

### [02 - Proof Loop](02-proof-loop.md)

A rigorous verification protocol where agents cannot self-certify completion. Requires durable artifacts (test outputs, logs, verdict files) as proof, verified by a fresh session that never saw the build process.

**When to use:** Any task where "it works on my machine" is not acceptable. Critical deployments. Tasks requiring audit trails. Multi-agent handoffs where trust boundaries matter.

**Source:** OpenClaw-RL paper (arxiv 2603.10165) + DenisSergeevitch/repo-task-proof-loop

---

### [03 - Autoresearch](03-autoresearch.md)

Iterative self-optimization through automated experimentation. Read one thing, change one thing, test mechanically, keep or discard, repeat. Scales from linear hill-climbing to branching version graphs with meta-optimization.

**When to use:** Improving any artifact with a measurable score -- prompts, skills, code coverage, latency, bundle size. NOT for subjective tasks without scriptable evaluation.

**Source:** Andrej Karpathy (github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) + HyperAgents paper [2603.19461]

---

### [04 - Deterministic Orchestration](04-deterministic-orchestration.md)

The principle that LLMs should never execute deterministic processes. Mechanical tasks (test, lint, format, detect) run as shell scripts; the LLM only handles creative/reasoning work. State lives in files, not in the agent's memory.

**When to use:** Any workflow with mechanical steps mixed with reasoning steps. Building skills with multi-step processes. Designing CI/CD-like agent pipelines.

**Source:** Deterministic orchestration patterns for AI coding agents

---

### [05 - Structured Reasoning](05-structured-reasoning.md)

Replaces free-form chain-of-thought with semi-formal reasoning: Premises, Execution Trace, Conclusions, Rejected Paths. Eliminates "planning hallucinations" where the model builds plausible but incorrect reasoning chains.

**When to use:** Debugging with non-obvious root causes. Architecture decisions with more than 2 options. Performance optimization. Security review. NOT needed for simple CRUD tasks.

**Source:** [2603.01896] Agentic Code Reasoning (Mar 2026)

---

### [06 - Multi-Agent Task Decomposition](06-multi-agent-decomposition.md)

Strategies for breaking complex tasks across multiple specialized agents. Defines when single-agent is sufficient (function-level) versus when multi-agent coordination is needed (system-level), and how to structure the coordinator.

**When to use:** Tasks touching more than 3 files. Cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, accessibility). System-level refactoring. Large feature implementations.

**Source:** [2603.14703] Multi-Agent System Optimization + [2603.13256] Training-Free Multi-Agent Coordination

---

### [07 - Codified Context](07-codified-context.md)

Treats project context as runtime infrastructure rather than documentation. CLAUDE.md is a runtime config, rules are conditional context injection, memory files are persistent state. Introduces JIT context loading to manage the context window efficiently.

**When to use:** Any project with AI agents. Setting up CLAUDE.md and memory systems. Managing context across long sessions. Designing handoff artifacts between agent sessions.

**Source:** [2602.20478] Codified Context: Infrastructure for AI Agents in a Complex Codebase

---

### [08 - Skills Best Practices](08-skills-best-practices.md)

Practical guide for creating reliable, discoverable Claude Code skills. Covers description-as-trigger design, mandatory sections (Gotchas, Troubleshooting), file structure conventions, and the principle that critical validations must be scripts, not prose.

**When to use:** Creating or updating any skill in `.claude/skills/`. Reviewing existing skills for quality. Designing skill libraries.

**Source:** Production experience across multiple Claude Code deployments

---

### [09 - Supply Chain Defense](09-supply-chain-defense.md)

Protect against malicious package updates by gating fresh packages. Set `min-release-age=7` (npm) and `exclude-newer = "7 days"` (uv) globally. Most poisoned packages are detected within 1-3 days; 7-day delay eliminates the attack window with near-zero friction.

**When to use:** Always. Every development machine, every CI runner. Override only for critical security patches that need immediate deployment.

**Source:** Industry practice in response to escalating open-source supply chain attacks (2024-2026)

---

### [10 - Agent Security](10-agent-security.md)

Comprehensive defense against prompt injection, tool poisoning, memory poisoning, sandbox escape, and data exfiltration targeting AI coding agents. Covers the full attack taxonomy with real CVEs, a six-layer defense architecture (content isolation, sandboxing, permissions, output filtering, MCP defenses, monitoring), and references to 16+ academic papers.

**When to use:** Always. Every AI agent deployment, every MCP server integration, every project that opens untrusted repositories. Designing agent permission models. Incident response for suspected agent compromise.

**Source:** OWASP Top 10 for LLM/Agentic Applications 2025-2026, CVE database, 16+ arxiv papers (2025-2026), industry research (HiddenLayer, Invariant Labs, Ona Security, Check Point, Trail of Bits)

---

### [11 - Documentation Integrity](11-documentation-integrity.md)

Validates documentation references at session start, not after failure. File paths, function names, and config values in CLAUDE.md and rules/ decay as the codebase evolves. A SessionStart hook runs a validator that catches drift before the agent acts on stale pointers.

**When to use:** Any project with CLAUDE.md or rules/ files that reference specific paths. Teams with multiple contributors. Projects where stale docs caused agent errors.

**Source:** Fiberplane drift-linter, Redis context rot patterns, Qt architecture-as-code

---

### [12 - Low-Signal Residual Training](12-low-signal-residual-training.md)

Patterns and traps for training ML models on subtle residual data (dodge & burn, frequency separation, retouching overlays). Documents 7 specific failure modes and solutions for training on low-signal targets where most pixels are near-zero.

**When to use:** Training LoRAs or models on edit residuals, overlay maps, or any target where signal is sparse and subtle. Image editing ML pipelines.

**Source:** Production LoRA training experiments on FLUX.2 Klein 9B

---

### [13 - Research Pipeline](13-research-pipeline.md)

After any research task, structured results go to a dedicated incoming folder - not just conversation history. Creates a persistent knowledge pipeline that feeds into the knowledge base, preventing repeat research.

**When to use:** After deep research sessions, security analyses, technology comparisons. Any structured analysis that produces reusable knowledge.

**Source:** Production workflow for a public knowledge base

---

### [14 - Managed Agents](14-managed-agents.md)

Infrastructure pattern for multi-agent systems: separate the brain (planning) from the hands (execution). Managed sub-agents get sandboxed environments with lazy provisioning. Covers Anthropic's Managed Agents API, Claude Code Agent Teams, and self-hosted alternatives.

**When to use:** Building multi-agent workflows. Deciding between managed vs self-hosted agent infrastructure. Designing brain/hands separation for complex tasks.

**Source:** Anthropic Engineering - "Managed Agents" (April 8, 2026), HiClaw/AgentScope (Alibaba)

---

### [15 - Red Lines (红线)](15-red-lines.md)

Absolute prohibitions that cannot be violated regardless of context. Separate from regular rules, higher priority, each anchored to a real incident. Enforcement hierarchy: hooks (mechanical) > rules (probabilistic) > nothing.

**When to use:** After any incident where an agent did something harmful with good intentions. Defining non-negotiable boundaries for your project. Choosing between rule-based and hook-based enforcement.

**Source:** Chinese engineering community (红线 pattern), OWASP ASI09

---

### [16 - Project Chronicles](16-project-chronicles.md)

A condensed timeline per long-running project that captures decisions, pivots, results, and dead ends. Sits between handoffs (tactical, session-scoped) and documentation (static). Each entry is 3-7 lines of strategic digest, not a handoff copy.

**When to use:** Any project spanning weeks/months with 3+ handoffs. Projects where multiple sessions contribute without a clear end date. When new sessions need to understand project history, not just "what's next."

**Source:** Production experience managing 10+ concurrent long-running projects with Claude Code

---

### [17 - DBS Skill Creation Framework](17-dbs-skill-creation.md)

Split skill content into Direction (logic, decision trees -> SKILL.md), Blueprints (templates, taxonomies -> references/), and Solutions (deterministic code -> scripts/). Prevents monolithic SKILL.md files where logic, data, and code are mixed.

**When to use:** Creating skills from research material. Structuring any complex skill with both reasoning and mechanical components.

### Composition Patterns

These principles are designed to layer:

1. **Optimization + Verification:** Use Autoresearch (03) for iterative improvement, then Proof Loop (02) for final sign-off.
2. **Decomposition + Evaluation:** Use Multi-Agent Decomposition (06) to split the work, Harness Design (01) to evaluate each piece.
3. **Context + Orchestration:** Use Codified Context (07) for state management, Deterministic Orchestration (04) for process control.
4. **Reasoning + Verification:** Use Structured Reasoning (05) to analyze, Proof Loop (02) to prove the analysis is correct.
5. **Security + Supply Chain:** Use Agent Security (10) for runtime defense against injection, Supply Chain Defense (09) for dependency-level protection. Together they cover both code-level and package-level attack vectors.
6. **Security + Proof Loop:** Use Agent Security (10) to prevent injection during build, Proof Loop (02) with fresh-session verification to catch any injection that persisted.
